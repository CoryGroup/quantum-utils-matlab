function A = unvec(v, sbasis, dims)
    % Unvectorizes the vector v. If no sbasis is supplied, the column stacking
    % convention is assumed.
    %
    % WARNING: this function was previously called mat. Any code using the old
    % function name should be changed.
    %
    % Arguments:
    %	- v:		The column vector to unvectorize into an array.
    %	- sbasis:	The unstacking basis, an instance of the Basis class OR the 
    %				strings 'col' or 'vec' to use column or row unstacking 
    %				conventions respectively. This input is optional, and when
    %				not present, the column unstacking convention will be used.
    %	- dims:		Only relevant if the row or column unstacking conventions
    %				used. In these cases, dims should be a vector containing
    %				the dimensions of the output array, of course satisfying
    %				prod(dims) = length(v). If the row or column unstacking
    %				conventions are set but dims is not, it will attempt to
    %				unvectorize into a square 2D array.
    %
    % Outputs:
    %	- A:		The unvectorized version of v
    %
    % See Also:
    %	- The Basis class and its children, in the +basis folder
    %	- The inverse of this function, vec
    %
    % Warning:
    %	It was unclear to me what the natural row stacking convention is for
    %	arrays with more than 3 indeces. The one at present does not seem quite
    %	natural, but it also seems that it is not worth my time to fix.
    %
    % Usage Example:
    %	A = magic(8);					% Create an 8x8 matrix
    %	B = basis.PauliONBasis(3);		% Create a 3qubit Pauli basis
    % 
    %	% Now we can verify that mat unvectorizes correctly:
    %	hsnorm(A - unvec(vec(A)))
    %	hsnorm(A - unvec(vec(A,'col'), 'col'))
    %	hsnorm(A - unvec(vec(A, B), B))
    %
    %	A = rand(4, 6, 2);		Some crazy array
    %	% Now we can verify that mat unvectorizes correctly:
    %	hsnorm(A - unvec(vec(A), 'col', [4, 6, 2]))		 % with column convention
    %   hsnorm(A - unvec(vec(A, 'row'), 'row', [4, 6, 2])) % with row convention
