function f = avggatefid(U1, U2)
    % Computes the average gate fidelity between two unitary matrices
    %
    % Arguments:
    %	- U1:	The first unitary
    %	- U2:	The second unitary
    %
    % Outputs:
    %	- f:		The average gate fidelity between the two;
    %				|<U1,U2>|^2/(2^N) where N=length(U1)=length(U2)
