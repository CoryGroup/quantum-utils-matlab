function usecvx(endpoint)
    % This function helps smooth out the integration of the quantum-utils
    % matlab package and the convex programming package CVX, which
    % quantum-utils uses. Both packages have the need to name their functions
    % certain things, and some of these names overlap, like vec. So this
    % function should be used on either side of a cvx program, and all it does
    % is switch the current path to the cvx folder, and then switch it back
    % when the convex program is done, so that during the convex program, CVX's
    % functions take precedence over quantum-util's functions. To ensure that
    % quantum util's functions take precedence otherwise, it should be at the
    % top of pathdef.m file. Calling this function with the input argument
    % 'postcvxinstall' will move it there.
    %
    % Arguments:
    %	- endpoint:     One of three values: 'begin', called just before a cvx
    %                   program; 'end', called just after a cvx program; and
    %                   'postcvxinstall', called after you have installed cvx
    %
    %
    % Usage Example:
    %		
    %	See dnorm.m code for an example
    %
