function q = s2q(str)
    % Converts a string of 0's and 1's into the corresponding qubit from the
    % computational basis
    %
    % Arguments:
    %	- str:	A string of 0's and 1's
    %
    % Outputs:
    %	- q:	the corresponding qubit from the computational basis
    %	
    %
    % Usage Example:
    %
    %	s2q('10101');
