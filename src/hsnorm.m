function x = hsnorm(A)
    % Computes the Hilbert-Schmidt norm (the norm induced by the
    % Hilbert-Schmidt inner-product) of a matrix. Sometimes also called the
    % Frobenius norm. Remark that hsnorm(A) = pnorm(A,2) for all A, but this
    % function is much faster.
    %
    % Arguments:
    %	- A:		A matrix
    %
    % Outputs:
    %	- x:		Returns sqrt(hs(A,A)). See hs.m
    %
    % Usage Example:
    %	hsnorm(rand(10))
    %	hsnorm(rand(1,10))
    %	hsnorm(rand(10,1))
