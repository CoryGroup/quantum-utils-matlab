function C = centralizer(K, L)
    % K is a basis for a subspace of the space spanned by the basis L, where 
    % L spans some Lie algebra. This function computes a basis for the
    % centralizer of K in L
    %
    % Arguments:
    %	- K:    A basis for a subspace of the space spanned by L; an instance
    %           of the basis.Basis class
    %   - L:    A basis for a Lie algebra (it is up to the user to ensure
    %           this); an instance of the basis.Basis class
    %
    % Outputs:
    %	- C:	An ON basis for the centralizer of K in L, ie, a basis for the
    %			subspace of L of maximal dimension such that every member
    %			commutes with every member of K
