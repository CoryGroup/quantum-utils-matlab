function x = hs(A,B)
    % Computes the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product of two matrices. In the case
    % that they are vectors, the usual inner product is computed.
    %
    % Arguments:
    %	- A,B:		Two square matrices (or 1D vectors) of the same dimension
    %
    % Outputs:
    %	- x:		Returns trace(A'*B) if matrices, or the equivalent if
    %				vectors
    %
    % Usage Example:
    %	hs(rand(10), rand(10))
    %	hs(rand(1,10), rand(10,1))	% whether they are columns or vectors or both does not matter, but the first is always conjugated
    %	hs(rand(10,1), rand(10,1))
