function x = ptrace(p, traceout, dims)
    % Takes the partial trace of a matrix p
    %
    % Arguments:
    %	p:			The matrix or vector to do a partial trace on
    %	traceout:	The subsystem(s) to trace out
    %	dims:		The dimensions of the tensor spaces
    %
    % Outputs:
    %   x:          The partial trace of p with respect to the parameters
    %               traceout and dims
    %
    % Usage Example:
    %		Suppose you have a qubit/qutrit/qubit system, so that p is a
    %		12x12 density matrix. Then:
    %
    %			ptrace(p, n, [2 3 2]) traces out the n'th system
    %			ptrace(p, [1 3], [2 3 2]) traces out both qubits
