function x = ptranspose(p, whichsys, dims)
    % Takes the partial transpose of a matrix p
    %
    % Arguments:
    %	p:			The matrix to do a partial transpose on.
    %	whichsys:	The subsystem(s) to transpose. This input is a list of
    %				indexes referring to dims.
    %	dims:		The dimensions of the tensor spaces.
    %
    % Outputs:
    %   x:          The partial transpose of p with respect to the parameters
    %               whichsys and dims
    %
    % Usage Example:
    %
    % Suppose you have a qubit/qutrit/qubit system, so that p is a
    % 12x12 density matrix. Then:
    %
    %	ptranspose(p, n, [2 3 2]);		% transposes the n'th system
    %	ptranspose(p, [1 3], [2 3 2]);  % transposes both qubits
