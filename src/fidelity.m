function F = fidelity(P, Q)
    % Computes the fidelity of the absolute values of P and Q. Typically,
    % the inputs will be positive semi-definite, in which case the absolute 
    % value is redundant.
    %
    % Arguments:
    %	- P:		A (positive semi-definite) matrix
    %	- Q:	A (positive semi-definite) matrix
    %
    % Outputs:
    %	- F:		F(|P|, |Q|); the fidelity of |P| and |Q|
    %
    % Usage Example:

	% compute the square root of |P|
	sqrtP = sqrtm(absm(P));

	% now just use the definition, remembering to use |Q| instead of Q
	F = abs(trace(sqrtm(sqrtP*absm(Q)*sqrtP)));
