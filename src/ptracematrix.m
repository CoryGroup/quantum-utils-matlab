function M = ptracematrix(traceout, dims)
    % The partial trace is a linear map, and as such, has a matrix form. This
    % is that matrix form with respect to the column stacking basis. (NOTE:
    % matrix form is a much more general function which can do the same thing.
    % Consider decapricating this function)
    %
    % Arguments:
    %	- traceout:	The subsystem(s) to trace out
    %	- dims:		The dimensions of the tensor spaces
    %
    % Outputs:
    %	- M:		The matrix form of ptrace, ie, a matrix M such that
    %				unvec(M*vec(X)) = ptrace(X, traceout, dims)
    %
    % See Also:
    %	ptrace, matrixform
