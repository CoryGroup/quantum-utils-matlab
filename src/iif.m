function y = iif(cond, iftrue, iffalse)
    % iif   Returns values based on a conditional test.
    %
    % iif(cond, iftrue, iffalse) returns iftrue if cond == 1 and returns
    % iffalse otherwise.
    %
    % This function is rather trivial, but has the nice effect of turning
    % if statements into expressions, a la the ternary if operator common to
    % many other languages (often written ?:).
    %
    % The main purpose of this function is to support automated code conversion
    % from languages that have ternary if operators.
